 URL : "https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/208" TITLE : assoc warning is unhelpful BODY : currently the warning emitted looks something like this: /home/mithrandi/deployment/virtualenvs/txaws/site-packages/attr/_funcs.py:173: deprecationwarning: assoc is deprecated and will be removed after 2018/01. i think this should pass an appropriate stacklevel so you can see where the calling code actually is.

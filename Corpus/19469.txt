 URL : "https://github.com/xiprox/WaniKani-for-Android/issues/67" TITLE : add contact method BODY : hi, i just wanted to send you a small message thanking you for the work you've done on the app, to accompany the in-app donation i also sent you 😄 but i couldn't find contact info, and since the app also has no contact button, i'll just write it here. hope you'll get yourself something nice to eat! またね~~
